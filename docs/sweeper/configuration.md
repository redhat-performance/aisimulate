subtitle: Core fields and optional adapter-owned search spaces

> **Experimental.** Sweeper's configuration schema may change without a standard deprecation period.

`SmartSearchConfig.search_space` contains backend and deployment fields. Optional feature-specific
search spaces are mappings under `SmartSearchConfig.adapters`.

For fixed-image E+agg/E+P+D search, see [Analytical EPD search](epd.md).
The SDK uses `search_space.encoder` with `workload.images`; it reuses AIC's
encoder model and does not expose per-request EPD replay or deployment outputs.

## Top-Level Shape

```yaml
search_space:
  model_name: example/model
  hardware_sku: h200_sxm
  prefill_hardware_sku: h200_sxm
  decode_hardware_sku: gb200
  gpu_budget: 32
  deployment_mode: [disagg, agg]
  backend: [vllm, sglang]
  backend_version:
    vllm: current
    sglang: current
  database_mode: HYBRID
  transfer_policy: balanced
  estimation_mode: auto
  fallback_policy: deny
  estimator_config:
    fpm_regression:
      min_observations: 5
  systems_paths: [default]

adapters:
  example.policy:
    search_space:
      mode: [balanced, latency]

workload:
  isl: 1024
  osl: 128
  request_rate: 4
  num_request_ratio: 10

goal:
  target: throughput_per_gpu
  # Optional legacy-compatible aggregate gating. Replay goodput remains
  # per-request; strict_sla filters aggregate means before ranking.
  strict_sla: true
  sla:
    ttft_ms: 800
    itl_ms: 30

sweep:
  max_rounds: 10
  candidates_per_round: 8
  parallel_evals: 4
```

The adapter value is a search space, not one concrete runtime configuration. Its provider validates
the whole mapping, contributes optimizer dimensions, and later materializes one concrete adapter
configuration for each candidate.

## Backend Fields

| Field | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `model_name` | required | model identifier |
| `hardware_sku` | required | AI Configurator system identifier |
| `prefill_hardware_sku` | `None` | optional disaggregated-prefill system override; inherits `hardware_sku` |
| `decode_hardware_sku` | `None` | optional disaggregated-decode system override; inherits `hardware_sku` |
| `deployment_mode` | `[disagg, agg]` | deployment branches to search |
| `backend` | `[vllm]` | engine backends to search |
| `backend_version` | `None` | exact version for one backend, or a per-backend version mapping; omitted backends resolve once to latest |
| `database_mode` | `SILICON` | forward-pass estimator data-source policy; see below |
| `transfer_policy` | `None` (all) | Core-owned empirical-transfer preset or tier list; used only by `HYBRID` and `EMPIRICAL` |
| `estimation_mode` | `auto` | search op-level, FPM interpolation, then regression; or select an explicit mode |
| `fallback_policy` | `deny` | constrain explicit estimator selection; auto always searches the full priority order |
| `estimator_config` | `{}` (Core defaults) | runtime tuning controls such as observation limits, regression buckets, correction bounds, and workload-axis capacity |
| `systems_paths` | omitted | preserve configured SDK/environment discovery; an explicit list sets ordered request-scoped roots, with `default` selecting the packaged Core root |
| `gpu_budget` | `32` | maximum GPUs per candidate |
| `min_gpu_budget` | `None` | optional lower bound during enumeration |
| `context_length` | `None` | optional KV-feasibility and runtime prompt-plus-output token limit |
| `prefill_context_length` | `None` | disaggregated prefill KV-feasibility and runtime limit; overrides `context_length` |
| `decode_context_length` | `None` | disaggregated decode KV-feasibility and runtime limit; overrides `context_length` |
| `parallel_configs` | `[]` | optional pinned parallel configurations |
| `startup_time` | `None` | optional simulated worker startup time |
| `aic_nextn` | `None` | optional speculative-decoding depth |

An explicit positive `context_length` is passed as AISimulate's internal
`max_model_len` for vLLM, TRT-LLM, and SGLang in both aggregated and
prefill/decode deployments. Prompts at or above the limit are rejected, and
generation stops when prompt plus output reaches the limit. When omitted,
Sweeper leaves this runtime limit unset. See [engine context limits](../core-api.md#engine-context-limits)
for the normalized contract and backend frontend differences.

Each engine role also has lists for `max_num_batched_tokens` and `max_num_seqs`, plus pinned block
size, GPU-memory-utilization, prefix-caching, and `<role>_forward_model` fields (`op_level` by default,
or `fpm` for whole-forward timing from a collected FPM cell). Set `<role>_fpm_parquet_path` to the
external parquet for that role (`agg`, `prefill`, or `decode`); the adjacent same-stem
`.metadata.json` sidecar is required. The path requires default timing with `forward_model: fpm`
and is preserved in deployment metadata, runtime arguments, and candidate YAML.
A one-item list pins a searched field.

### Role-specific context limits

The public recommendation fields `engine.workers.prefill.context_length` and
`engine.workers.decode.context_length` map to `prefill_context_length` and
`decode_context_length` in the Sweeper search space. Values must be positive. They apply only to
disaggregated prefill/decode workers; aggregated recommendations must use the shared
`engine.context_length` field. For each role, the effective limit is the role-specific override
when set, otherwise the shared `context_length`, otherwise the model's configured maximum context.
The effective value is used both by KV-feasibility filtering and by generated worker
`max_model_len` payloads. AFD companion branches use the limit for the companion role.

This precedence is intentionally a runtime contract rather than a new performance-model input:
the model maximum comes from the resolved model metadata, while role-specific values are explicit
operator limits. The regression matrix in
[`context-limits.md`](context-limits.md#selection-evidence) records the expected before/after
selection behavior for aggregate, disaggregated, heterogeneous, and AFD companion branches.

`prefill_hardware_sku` and `decode_hardware_sku` apply only to the ordinary `disagg` branch. Either
override may be set independently: an omitted role inherits `hardware_sku`. Both roles still share
the configured model, backend, backend version, and total `gpu_budget`. When `backend_version` is
omitted, the latest performance-data version for both effective SKUs must match; otherwise pin one
version supported by both systems. These overrides are part of the Sweeper YAML/SDK contract; the
separate `aisimulate recommend` input continues to describe one shared hardware SKU.

The current Dynamo Router adapter uses the shared `hardware_sku` for
`prefill_load_model.type: aic`. Sweeper rejects a candidate before replay when its materialized
Router AIC system differs from the effective prefill SKU. This also affects matching overrides:
`hardware_sku: h200_sxm` with both role SKUs set to `gb200` needs a GB200 prefill load model.
Use a Router provider that consumes `prefill_hardware_sku`, or select a non-AIC load model.
Correctly materialized AIC hooks, decode-only overrides, and shared-SKU behavior remain supported.

## Attention-FFN Disaggregation

AFD is supported by public `aisimulate predict` and `aisimulate recommend` with the built-in
analytical engine runner. See the [AFD Topology Contract](afd-topology.md) for public configuration
and replay limits. The internal `SmartSearchConfig` schema uses topology `afd` or `afd+pd`;
an injected runner must explicitly advertise the selected backend with the chosen topology.

This pinned pure-AFD example creates a finite standard Sweeper branch:

```yaml
search_space:
  deployment_mode: [afd]
  backend: [trtllm]
  model_name: Qwen/Qwen3-32B
  hardware_sku: h200_sxm
  gpu_budget: 32
  afd_phase: both
  afd_pinned_topologies:
    - n_a_nodes: 2
      n_f_nodes: 2
      tp_a: 4
      a_batch_size: 64
      f_moe_ep_size: 1
      num_microbatches: 3
      pipeline_model: optimistic

workload:
  isl: 1024
  osl: 128
  concurrency: 64
  num_request_ratio: 10
```

Use `deployment_mode: [afd+pd]` with `afd_phase: prefill` or `decode` to search a companion for the
opposite phase. The companion uses that phase's ordinary `max_num_batched_tokens`, `max_num_seqs`,
block-size, and memory fields. Optional `afd_companion_parallel_configs` pins its parallel shapes.
Searched (non-pinned) AFD requires an explicit `afd_batch_size_candidates` list. The finite domain
also supports `afd_tp_a_candidates`, `afd_f_moe_ep_size_candidates`,
`afd_microbatch_candidates`, `afd_pipeline_model_candidates`, and `afd_max_candidates`.

AFD rejects `kv_load_ratio` until the execution layer exposes scheduler-visible KV capacity. The
current performance-model adapter also requires concrete positive `isl` and `osl`, so use a
synthetic request rate or absolute concurrency rather than a trace-only workload. The complete
topology and capability contract is documented in [AFD Topology Contract](afd-topology.md).

Estimator controls are parsed once, then each concrete regular language-worker candidate
resolves through Core after TP, PP, attention-DP, MoE parallelism, and block size are known.
`estimation_mode` defaults to `auto` and searches op-level, FPM interpolation, then regression.
`fallback_policy` defaults to `deny`: it constrains explicit modes and does not disable auto
selection. `estimator_config` carries the complete nested configuration described in the
[Core API](../core-api.md#estimator-controls). Regression must have a ready fit before an
offline trial can execute; unavailable or cold estimators fail candidate materialization.

Core pins the effective backend version, estimator mode, transfer policy, selected system root,
and all estimator controls. Replay and candidate artifacts preserve that resolved identity.
Generated prediction YAML records role-specific pins and can be passed directly to `predict`.
AFD, analytical encoder, and custom fixed/polynomial timing paths retain their existing providers;
nondefault public estimator policies require regular language workers with default timing.

Database modes choose the source of each operation estimate:

| Mode | Resolution |
|---|---|
| `SILICON` | collected performance data and supported interpolation only |
| `HYBRID` | collected data first; calibrated empirical estimation for uncovered operations |
| `EMPIRICAL` | calibrated estimation for every operation (`latency = SOL / utilization`) |
| `SOL` | uncalibrated analytic speed-of-light estimate |

`SOL_FULL` is a low-level per-call diagnostic, not an estimator default; public
prediction and Sweeper configuration reject it.

`transfer_policy` is not a search dimension. It selects which fixed Core transfer kinds the
empirical forward-pass estimator may use when its own calibration slice is missing. It accepts `off`,
`conservative`, `balanced`, or `aggressive`, or an explicit list containing `xshape`, `xquant`,
`xprofile`, and `xop`. Core validates the request and the Sweeper records the normalized explicit
policy in every candidate. The field is ignored by `SILICON` and `SOL`.

## Pinned Parallel Configurations

Pinning `parallel_configs` requires exactly one deployment mode. An aggregated entry is one shape:

```yaml
search_space:
  deployment_mode: [agg]
  parallel_configs:
    - tp: 4
      attention_dp: 2
      replicas: 2
```

A disaggregated entry contains `prefill` and `decode` shapes. Every pinned shape must be legal,
KV-feasible, supported by at least one selected backend, and accepted by the configured Replay
runner. If every selected backend/topology pair is runner-incompatible, preflight raises
`aisimulate.sweeper.RunnerIncompatibleError` with the rejected mode and backend names.

## Provider Selection

Adapter names are provider entry-point names. A provider can be installed through the
`aisimulate.sweep_config_providers` entry-point group or injected into the `Sweeper` constructor:

```python
sweeper = Sweeper(
    runner_factory=my_runner_factory,
    providers={"example.policy": my_provider},
)
```

Sweeper loads only names present under `adapters`. See [Sweep Configuration
Providers](sweep-config-provider.md) for the complete ABI.

## Strict Aggregate SLA

The default SLA behavior is replay goodput: requests are individually counted against every
configured bound, and an unset TTFT or ITL field is unbounded. Set `goal.strict_sla: true`
to additionally require the aggregate candidate means to stay within every configured bound
before scalar ranking or Pareto dominance. Bounds are inclusive. Missing metrics and zero
qualifying latency samples fail closed.

## Sampler Algorithm Override

The experimental `AISIMULATE_SWEEPER_VIZIER_ALGO` environment variable overrides the Vizier
algorithm. For example, set it to `RANDOM_SEARCH` to bypass the default GP-bandit designer.
`SPICA_VIZIER_ALGO` remains a deprecated fallback during migration; when both are set, the
AI Simulate variable takes precedence.

## Host Offload and Removed KVBM Fields

Sweeper rejects the old KVBM block-count, transfer-bandwidth, offload-batch-size, and cache-hit
search fields. Those legacy fields have no adapter migration.

The public `predict` and `recommend` commands support a separate native host-offload descriptor
at `engine.workers.aggregated.kv_cache.host_offload`. It sets `num_host_blocks`,
`d2h_bandwidth_gbps`, and `h2d_bandwidth_gbps` as fixed values, not search dimensions. It requires
aggregated vLLM, prefix caching enabled, and `attention_data: 1`; native speculative decoding is
not supported. For `recommend`, mode and backend must be concrete, the parallelism preset must be
disabled (`preset: false`), and `attention_data` must be fixed to `1`. Other parallelism knobs,
such as `tensor` and `replicas`, may still be searched. This does not add disk offload or restore
the removed KVBM search fields.

See [Native vLLM host-offload prediction](../cli/user-guide.md#native-vllm-host-offload-prediction)
for a complete YAML example and CLI command.

### Pinned engine and request controls

Engine controls are pinned for a study; they do not add optimizer dimensions.
`SearchSpace` accepts `enable_eplb`, `wideep_num_slots`, `moe_backend`,
`attention_backend`, `gemm_quant_mode`, `moe_quant_mode`, `kvcache_quant_mode`,
`fmha_quant_mode`, and `comm_quant_mode`. They travel in the canonical
`ForwardPassPerfModelConfig` through exact candidate construction, saved
prediction YAML, and native replay. Quantization overrides also participate in
KV feasibility and capacity-cache identity. EPLB, slots, and MoE backend
selection require an MoE model; nondefault MoE backends require SGLang.
Collected FPM interpolation rejects EPLB, slot, and MoE-backend overrides that
its cells cannot represent. Custom timing, AFD, and analytical encoder runs
reject these model controls.

`aic_nextn` is the compute-side MTP draft depth (0–5); zero disables MTP.
For a positive depth, set `nextn_accepted`
explicitly to the expected number of accepted draft tokens, between zero and
that depth. Replay realizes a fractional expected count with guaranteed whole
tokens followed by one Bernoulli token; it does not estimate model acceptance.
`enable_chunked_prefill` is optional and applies to aggregated/prefill roles;
omission preserves the backend default.

`Workload.cached_prefix_tokens` is an exact shared prefix for synthetic traffic.
It must fit the shortest generated input, including a configured random-length
range. It creates shared tokens and does not prewarm the KV cache: the first
request is cold, and subsequent reuse follows backend cache and block rules.
Positive cached prefixes are unsupported for AFD and AFD+PD.

The model controls above and synthetic cached prefixes are supported by
`--stack engine`. Optional runners, including Dynamo, must explicitly advertise
these capabilities before accepting them; older adapters are rejected before
replay. Their downstream schemas and synthetic-input bindings require separate
qualification.

Use `context_length` for the sequence limit and each role's existing memory
fraction controls for KV sizing. The deprecated `enable_wideep` switch is not
exposed; current topology selects the MoE execution regime.
